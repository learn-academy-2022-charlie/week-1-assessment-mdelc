# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is software on our computer for code while Github is the cloud where we can organize and keep our code.

  Researched answer: Git is a software tool on our local computer that allows us to track our projects over time.

  Github is a hosting service for Git repositories.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: As learned in class, a Boolean value will return either true or false. We can use AND, OR, NOT to have a Boolean value returned.

  Researched answer: There are 6 different operators in JavaScript - Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, Assignment, Conditional, and Ternary. Comparison operators include == , === , != , > , < , >= , <= and return true or false. Logical combines at least two conditions and can use && , || , !  - AND OR and NOT.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: JavaScript uses zero indexing meaning instead of beginning the count at 1 when counting the number of characters or values in a data type, it begins at 0. A value can be a number, string, or boolean value - true or false.

  Researched answer: According to w3resources, the index property is a read-only property containing the position of an expression.

  There are different types of values. We've so far learned of primitive values in class - numbers, strings, boolean, and undefined.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: A single iteration would be completing 1 single cycle task that could be of many.

  Researched answer: We learned about for loops in class which can use iterations to process the code.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming includes one of the students being a "driver" where they share their screen and are typing the coding while the other student "navigates" and helps dictate and research. It's important that each student is able to have enough time to contribute and also to have their input heard.

  Researched answer: Proper techniques allow students to feel less overwhelmed with a task by themselves. It allows at least 2 pairs of eyes to see what code is used and to be able to have students focus more. It can also help by incorporating at least 2 people's skills and knowledge as opposed to just relying on just the one.
